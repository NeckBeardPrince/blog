### Who Am I?

I wear many hats in both my professional and personal life. By day, I serve as the **Lead Cloud Infrastructure/Platform Engineer** and **ISSO/ISSE** for NASA’s internal Platform as a Service. In this role, I manage hundreds of servers in Kubernetes environments, ensuring they meet the rigorous compliance standards of **FedRAMP**, **ITAR**, and **EAR** regulations. It’s a challenging and rewarding position that keeps me constantly learning and innovating.

Outside of work, I’m a proud husband and a dad to two wonderful kids. Our family wouldn’t be complete without our lovable dogs, Tux and Max. We’re all about making memories, whether it’s through family adventures, outdoor activities, or simply enjoying time together at home.
